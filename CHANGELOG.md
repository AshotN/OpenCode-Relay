  <li>Allow the success notifications shown after sending file, folder, or selection references to OpenCode to be disabled via the IDE notification's <code>Do not ask again</code> option.</li>

  <li><code>RejectedExecutionException</code> when replacing the current project in the same IDE window while late OpenCode server callbacks are still being delivered.</li>
